altcoin-google-spreadsheet
==========================

Altcoin price tracker into a google spreadsheet.

See the [Live Demo](http://goo.gl/RvCxne ) 

![Livedemoscreehshot](http://www.lize.it/up/altcoin_screenshot.png)

#How does it work?
It scrapes data from http://coinmarketcap.com . The data is contained in the sheet called *Price Ticker*

#How to use it

There are a few steps needed for having this work on your own spreadsheet: 
- Make a copy of the [Live Demo](http://goo.gl/RvCxne )  and open it
- Past the content of [Code.gs](https://github.com/adv0r/altcoin-google-spreadsheet/blob/master/Code.gs) into a new script
- Create a new trigger that calls the function *transferValue()* every 5 minutes
- Done

If you need help in setting this up, I'll be glad to help. Mail *nico@botcoin.io* and attach some coins if you want to get out of the noise ;) .
